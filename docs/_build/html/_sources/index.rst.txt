What is WAS?
------------

The World Archive System is a modular, high-fidelity knowledge architecture that aggregates multi-domain data into a real-time decision-support layer. Inspired by the symbolic Was-scepter—carried by Egyptian deities as a staff of authority—this system provides both clarity and command across the operational spectrum.

Key Features
-----------

* **Automated Decision Confidence**: Syncs data from sensors, operators, and embedded systems
* **Mission Resilience**: Real-time anomaly detection and adaptive signal routing
* **Cognitive Interoperability**: Delivers intel in the mission's native logic, whether ISR, cyber, or logistics
* **Open-Source Intelligence Networks**: Leverages public dev platforms for passive telemetry through voluntary user participation

Architecture Overview
--------------------

WAS leverages open-source paradigms to create passive telemetry networks through "good Samaritan" public works. By developing open-source tools that power users actually want to use—similar to how TikTok's algorithm attracts content creators—WAS generates valuable Points of Interest (POI) user data that enhances mission capabilities.

Integration Capabilities
-----------------------

* **Technical Data & ILS**: Enrich IETMs with telemetry and temporal metadata
* **Model-based Systems & AI**: Sync mission-sim outputs with real-world event timing
* **VR Training & Digital Twin**: Integrate telemetry-aligned trigger nodes for enhanced realism
* **Additive & Engineering Tools**: Connect CAD/sim artifacts with knowledge metadata
* **Open-source Intel**: Leverage public dev platforms for passive telemetry networks

Use Cases
---------

* **C5ISR Operations**: Enhanced situational awareness and decision support
* **Mission Planning**: Real-time data integration for improved accuracy
* **Training & Simulation**: Immersive environments with telemetry-driven scenarios
* **Intelligence Gathering**: Passive data collection through public platforms
* **Defense Technology**: Force multiplier for existing military systems
